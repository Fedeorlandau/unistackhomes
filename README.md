This is an example project using [Uniform](https://uniform.dev/) and [Contenstack](https://www.contentstack.com/) by [Valtech](http://valtech.com)

## Intro
We've set up a real state agency demo using both uniform and contenstack systems. This app is enabled by [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Getting Started
First, create a new `.env` file by using `.env.example` as a guideline. If you don't know how to get your keys please reach out in our teams channel.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
#or
yarn install
```

## Run the solution
```bash
npm run dev
#or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4120](http://localhost:4120) with your browser to see the result.
